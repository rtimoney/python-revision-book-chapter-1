print('Hello World!')

# comments are declared using a hashkey

# declaring a valuable and initializing (assigning a value)
a = 8

# printing the variable a will display its value in the terminal/console
print (a)

# in Python, multiple variables can be assigned in sequence
b = c = d = 234

print (b)
print (c)
print (d)

# in Python, variables are not typecast

# int
message  = "I am an integer"
print (message)
print (b)

#string
message  = "I am now a string"
print (message)
b = "I'm going through chaaaaangeeesss"
print (b)

#float
message  = "I am now a floating point"
print (message)
b = 234.56
print (b)

#boolean
message  = "I am now a boolean"
print (message)
b  = True
print (b)

# concatinating example
running = True
print('Run state : ' , running)

# it kis good practice to choose meaniful names for variables which allow yourself and others to easily follow code
